%Peers from outside of Central State University providing letters of support should possess knowledge of your most recent teaching, research, and/or service accomplishments. Letters from peers may address both professional and personal traits that affirm you as a teacher, advisor, and mentor of students. Letters from peers may be used to comment on any knowledge that the peer may have of your contributions to your discipline in terms of research/publications, creative work, technical reports and professional panel participations. The letters need to include the correspondentâ€™s current institutional information (e.g. their institutional affiliation, rank, position held, etc.). If the peer does not provide such information, please supply that information to the committee.
