%Candidates should document their peer-reviewed publications and/or creative achievements in their field.
%(A). Research Publications. List academic publications according to the following categories: Refereed Journals, Books, and Other. Other may include chapters in edited collections, proceedings of meetings, edited texts. Document your publications with reviews of your work, letters of acceptance from editors, photocopies of title pages, the first few pages of the article, etc. In cases of multiple authorship, a narrative description (approx. 250 words or less) of the candidate’s intellectual contribution is required. Do not include self-published works or non-academic publications in this category.
%For promotion, accomplishments since coming to CSU are of far greater importance than achievements at another institution.
%(B). Creative achievements pertinent to the candidate’s professional focus. List creative achievements, including the following categories: artwork, collections, compositions, curated exhibits, exhibited artwork, art and graphic design commissions, moving image, multimedia/databases/websites, radio & television, music recitals & theatrical performances, recordings, juried shows, creative writing readings. Indicate whether each work was juried, invited, reproduced, cited/reviewed in publications, and whether each work was international, national, regional/state, or local in scope.
%The creative production and professional work in fields such as fine and performing arts should be accepted as equivalent to scholarly publication or research.
%(C). Other New or Innovative Scholarly Achievements. Candidates should document other, not easily categorized scholarly achievements.
%Examples include publication of an annotated review of literature on a topic relevant to teaching or research discipline; publication of analysis of data collected on new teaching methods, or evidence of adoption by peers of a mentoring or teaching process developed by the candidate.
